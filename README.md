# savings-with-sanders
A minimal static website using Jekyll and Javascript to calculate taxes under Bernie Sanders' tax plan. I chose Jekyll because I want this website to be easy for anyone and everyone to run on their devices. Ideally, I also want the page to work independent of a server so one can save the HTML page and use the calculator offline.

Right now, the project is only a small foundation with no real algorithms.
