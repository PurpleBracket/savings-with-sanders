# Savings with Sanders
A minimal static website using [www.jekyllrb.com](Jekyll) generated static HTML and Javascript to calculate taxes under Bernie Sanders' tax plan.

I chose Jekyll because I want this website to be easy for anyone and everyone to run on their devices while also allowing the flexibility of news posts. Ideally, I want the page to work independent of a server so one can save the HTML page and use the calculator offline.

Right now, the project is only a small foundation with no real algorithms.

I'm fully aware that some people may pay more taxes under Bernie's tax plan, but I couldn't resist the alliteration.

#How to run
1. Install Jekyll
2. While in the project's root directory, run jekyll serve
